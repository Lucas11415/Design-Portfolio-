            <p>My name is Lucas Neira. Im right now 22 years old. I was born in Santiago Chile until my parents decide to go to the US. I have 5 cousins, 1 aunt, my mom, my dad, my grandmother and my grandfather. My favorite thing to do is art because I love to make my own images and decide to create characters and backgrounds in my own style. My majors is fine arts and I want to improve myself to become a great artist. My strength is writing, drawing, painting, science, history, and computers. My main weakness is math and sometimes reading because math feels very complex in real life and I don’t understand some words when I’m reading. The reason I want to go to college because I want to live free and make my own decisions of what I want to be in the near future. I also want to make money to live alone and become an independent person. I also want to make friends that actually cares about me and not leaving me behind. I choose LaGuardia College because of its location and this is the first college that I went on a trip on. Also this my first experience to apply for college. 
            My hopes about school are trying to pass every single class for each semester and try to succeed to earn my freedom. If you want to see more about myself, you can use my youtube link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6Ymm48SxEvoChkFSszt74A/featured">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6Ymm48SxEvoChkFSszt74A/featured</a>.

                <div class="internalcontainerL"><h1>Illustration</h1><img class="images" src="images 3/illustration.jpg" width="100%"/>When it comes to art it pops up in my mind. Art is not only a part of skill but is a part of life. Art is everywhere around the world and includes the inside and outside. Depending on what kind of idea you want to do with art. The basics of art are looking for patterns and crazy colors. We see our shadow where each side of our color goes from light to dark or dark to light. Art is so many opportunities to choose from. Any form of ideas that are common or unique. The start of illustration is to know how our world is connected to others and finds a deeper message that we can be able to understand clearly.  It is at once highly visible while being invisible, and it has an influence that transforms our visual culture to give people a voice and our lives more meaning.</div>
                <div class="internalcontainerM"><h1>3D Design</h1><img class="images" src="images 3/model 2.JPG" width="100%"/>When it comes to art, it gives you experience in so many ways. Art is a way of life. The more it becomes important, the more it starts evolving. When technology exists, art is becoming different. It is called 3d model designing. It is a part of the skill that will help to create better pieces of art that can be used to create special things such as a product, a show, or an event. It starts to get complicated because it requires to use of a program for your computer. The program is not free because I have to pay for using it, but since it's my first time, I get a free trial for it.
                    From my experience, I find it difficult because when I use my computer, it feels really slow. I almost feel like I'm going to have stress after this. So I decided to fix my computer so it would work correctly. After that, I decided to create my first model. I'm used to be good when it comes to 2d models because of its just a flat image. However, for 3d modeling is a bit confusing because the number of dimensions that you see from each side makes it look like you see in real life.
                     My first model is the hospital that I used to come to when I was a child. It's almost closed to my own home. I use the original image to see how the structure looks like when I create the model in the program. As I figure out about the use of tools that the program offers.
                    The second model I create is a fan. It is an inspiration for my mom's fan. It is a fan that helps keep it a breeze and can also inhale the dust. The model is simple because it looks like that. 
                    The third model is a smartphone that looks really nice to own. Unlike Apple and Samsung I decide to create a design that looks very modern and still keeps the features such as buttons and a headphone jack. 
                    The Fourth model is a house because I wanted to see how my house would like it if I own one. It will feature a backyard, 2 bedrooms, one bathroom, a basement, and an attic. I also add a garage to park my car.
                   The 5th model is a bed because I want to design to see if it's comfortable for a person to rest on. The sixth model is either a hotel or a parking lot. The seventh model is like a dome stadium or a concert. The 8th model is a fan ,made in a 2d and 3d like figure. The 9th is a pyramid and the 10th is a crystal-like structure. I think it might be a table or a speaker.</div>
                <div class="internalcontainerR"><h1>Photoshop/Photography</h1><img class="images" src="images 3/water..JPG" width="100%"/> Photoshop is software that is extensively used for raster image editing, graphic design and digital art. It makes use of layering to allow for depth and flexibility in the design and editing process, as well as provide powerful editing tools, that when combined, are capable of just about anything.</div>

            <div class="internalcontainerL"><h1>Web Developing/Design/Coding </h1><img class="images" src="images 3/website.png" width="100%"/>Responsive design can help you solve a lot of problems for your website. It will make your site mobile-friendly, improve the way it looks on devices with both large and small screens, and increase the amount of time that visitors spend on your site. It can also help you improve your rankings in search engines. Essentially, responsive design is a way to put together a website so that it automatically scales its content and elements to match the screen size on which it is viewed. It keeps images from being larger than the screen width, and prevents visitors on mobile devices from needing to do extra work to read your content.

                The ultimate goal of responsive design is to avoid the unnecessary resizing, scrolling, zooming, or panning that occurs with sites that have not been optimized for different devices. From my first website design project, I have little experience on coding because I started from my first computer class. My first project is a simple question and answers tool website where it have 3 option tools to use for just educational purposes such as generated questions, translation, and plagerism check. It starts with 3 simple questions and it can be change with the question generator. The design of the page is used with elements that helps to keep each borders to keep in position. Use a jpg as a background a logo on the top left and try to manage to use columns and press buttons.</div>
                <div class="internalcontainerM"><h1>Logo/brand design </h1><img class="images" src="images 3/Coffee.png" width="100%"/>The primary role of a logo is to identity. Trends come and go, design tools and techniques will evolve, what we perceive a logo to be may even drastically change with time, but for all eternity the single most important goal of a logo will always remain this – to identify the person, product, business or service you’re designing it for. As a designer (or business owner), before working on any ideas you need to fully understand the environment in which the logo will be seen. Who are the brands competitors and how do they look? What colors and symbols are already owned by established competition? How can we differentiate the logo so the business stands out from the crowd? When you picture a business in your mind, you often immediately picture the logo, be it the golden arches of a famous fast food company, or the apple with the bite out of it representing one of my favorite technology brands. Although a logos primary purpose is to identity, they can also be leveraged to communicate important brand messages and values. Just make sure to keep it simple to know what the company mainly stands for.</div>
                <div class="internalcontainerR"><h1>Package/Product Design </h1><img class="images" src="images 3/Product.JPG" src="images 3/structure.JPG" width="100%"/>The way of how I design art is a big challenge when it comes to ideas that everybody suggest.  I can be capable of using these ideas in the process, but not most of time. Some parts of measuring and sharping to create the perfect can be difficult because sometimes it does go in the way I expected to be. I can’t even get parallel shapes correctly because its not the right measure. I sometimes lose my way of thinking because I didn’t have enough time to do it. I think is best to be consistent when it comes to make your ideas for your next project and see how it go out in the end. Try to ask someone if there is time to help out your skills of designing. It will be a balanced work and the results will come out after.●You may be lucky to get your work done in the way you expected to be. My idea of package designing is that I want to find what is the best model to keep people interested. Another thing is that some items have different shapes and forms. That is why most packages are different so items will be capable to fit.
